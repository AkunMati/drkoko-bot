The library is in alpha stage and the API is subject to change.

## Installation

To enable metrics, weâ€™ll import a few items from OpenCensus Core package.

```javascript
const { Stats, MeasureUnit, AggregationType } = require('@opencensus/core');

// Create the Stats manager
const stats = new Stats();

// The latency in milliseconds
const mLatencyMs = stats.createMeasureDouble(
  "repl/latency",
  MeasureUnit.MS,
