OpenCensus for Node.js is an implementation of OpenCensus, a toolkit for collecting application performance and behavior monitoring data. It currently includes 3 apis: stats, tracing and tags.

The library is in alpha stage and the API is subject to change.

## Installation

Install the opencensus-core package with NPM:
```bash
npm install @opencensus/core
```

## Usage

#### Get the global Stats manager instance.

To enable metrics, weâ€™ll import a few items from OpenCensus Core package.

```javascript
const { globalStats, MeasureUnit, AggregationType, TagMap } = require('@opencensus/core');

// The latency in milliseconds
const mLatencyMs = globalStats.createMeasureDouble(
  "repl/latency",
  MeasureUnit.MS,
  "The latency in milliseconds"
);
